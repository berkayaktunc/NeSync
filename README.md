# NeSync

_Pronounced as_ __Any Sync__.

__NeSync__ is a modern backup/sync software for desktop with a GUI.<br>
It monitors your filesytem for events (modification, create, delete and move) then adds detected changes to your files in historical order.
In each revision you can add description to changed file. It works with every file format and compatible with __Linux__, __Windows__ and __MacOS__.
<br><br>
NeSync uses intenal filesystem which is OS independent.
That is, you create your own folder tree inside the app then assign this folders to your OS file system. 
This allows you to transfer your folder tree (with historical changes) from computer to computer (even between different OSes).
Transfers are done via zip files (manually exported and imported as zip by the user).
<br><br>
__NeSync does not connect to the internet and works offline completely.__<br>
NeSync is __Free and open-source software (FOSS)__ and source code licensed under GPL v3 (completely open to the public).

__WARNING: NeSync is currently in pre-alpha stage and it's not complete yet.__
